Welcome to my website! I’m SayedMorteza Malaekeh, a Ph.D. student in Sustainable Systems Engineering at UT Austin, also pursuing a Master’s in Economics. I’m a graduate research assistant at the Rapid, Equitable, & Sustainable Energy Transitions Lab (RESET-LAB), supervised by Prof. Sergio Castellanos, and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).

I hold bachelor’s and master’s degrees in engineering with a minor in economics from Sharif University of Technology and was an exchange graduate student in Applied Mathematics at Saint Petersburg State University. I also spent last summer as a visiting researcher at Caltech’s Division of Social Sciences, hosted by Prof. Hannah Drucknemiller.

My research focuses on environmental and energy economics and policy, incorporating elements of household finance and public economics. On the methods side, I am particularly interested in causal inference for complex issues, such as continuous treatments and unstructured data (e.g., images, graphs, text), where I leverage deep learning and machine learning to develop innovative solutions.

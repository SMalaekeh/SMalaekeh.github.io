# Hey there, thanks for stopping by!

I’m **SayedMorteza Malaekeh**, a Ph.D. student in **Sustainable Systems Engineering** at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), also pursuing a **Master’s in Economics**. I am a graduate research assistant at the [Rapid, Equitable, & Sustainable Energy Transitions Lab (RESET-LAB)](https://www.reset-lab.com/), supervised by [Prof. Sergio Castellanos](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/castellanos), and at the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)](https://emp.lbl.gov/).

At LBNL and RESET-LAB, I lead research on **household finance and energy economics**, analyzing a **13+ TB Experian credit dataset** of 10M U.S. households from 2010–2023 for solar PV adopters (treatment group) and non-adopters (control group). Using methods such as **synthetic control** and **staggered difference-in-differences**, I estimate the household-level financial impacts of solar PV adoption, bridging energy transition research with household finance. In my recent work, I studied the **diffusion of residential solar photovoltaics across racial and ethnic groups in the U.S.**, published in *Energy Policy* (2025), highlighting unequal adoption patterns and their implications for equitable energy transitions and policy-making.

I am also a **Visiting PhD Researcher at the California Institute of Technology (2024 & 2025)** in the Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences (Economics and Computer Science), hosted by [Prof. Hannah Druckenmiller](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/hannah-druckenmiller). At Caltech, I develop **new methods for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) with image-based treatments**, integrating Vision Transformers, CNNs, and Autoencoders into R-Learner and Causal Forest. These methods are applied to **large-scale multimodal datasets** to address **economics questions in environmental policy and decision making**

I hold bachelor’s and master’s degrees in **Civil and Water Resources Engineering** (*with highest distinction*) with a minor in economics from **Sharif University of Technology**, and was an **exchange graduate student** in Applied Mathematics at [Saint Petersburg State University](https://english.spbu.ru/).

My research lies at the intersection of **environmental & energy economics and household finance**. Methodologically, I focus on **causal inference in complex settings** (spatial spillover effect estimation, continuous treatments; unstructured data such as images, graphs, and text), leveraging **machine learning and deep learning** to support **decision-making under uncertainty**.

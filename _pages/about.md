**Visiting PhD Researcher at Caltech | Causal AI, Economics, Sustainability**  

I am **seeking Summer 2025 internships** in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning Engineering**, **Quant Research**, and/or **Energy**.

I’m **SayedMorteza (Morteza) Malaekeh**, a Ph.D. student in **Sustainable Systems Engineering** at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), also pursuing a **Master’s in Economics**. I work in the [Rapid, Equitable, & Sustainable Energy Transitions Lab (RESET-LAB)](https://www.reset-lab.com/), supervised by [Prof. Sergio Castellanos](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/castellanos), in collaboration with the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)](https://emp.lbl.gov/).

At RESET-LAB, I lead a project with **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory** on household finance and energy economics, working with a 13+ TB Experian credit report dataset covering 10M U.S. households (2010–2023). Using synthetic control and staggered difference-in-differences, I study the household financial impacts of residential solar adoption. My recent work on racial and ethnic gaps in solar PV diffusion is published in *Energy Policy* (2025).

I am also a **Visiting PhD Researcher at the [California Institute of Technology](https://caltech.edu) (2024 & 2025)** in HSS (Economics & Computer Science), hosted by [Prof. Hannah Druckenmiller](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/hannah-druckenmiller). At Caltech, I develop conditional average treatment effect estimation methods for image-based treatments, integrating Transformer Architecture, CNNs, and Autoencoders into R-Learner and Causal Forest for large-scale multimodal policy datasets.

I hold bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Engineering (*highest distinction*) with a minor in economics from **Sharif University of Technology**, and completed a graduate exchange in Applied Mathematics at [**Saint Petersburg State University**](https://english.spbu.ru/).

My research spans **energy & environmental economics, household finance, and causal ML**, focusing on **continuous treatments, spatial spillovers, and unstructured data** (images, graphs, text) to support **decision-making under uncertainty**.
